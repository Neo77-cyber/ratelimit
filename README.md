# Rate Limit Application

This is a rate limit application that helps you control and manage the rate at which clients can access your API endpoints. It is built using FastAPI and Docker, providing an easy and scalable solution for rate limiting.

## Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Set limits on the number of requests clients can make within a specific time frame.
- **IP-based Throttling**: Throttle requests based on the client's IP address.
- **Customizable Limits**: Configure rate limits based on your specific requirements.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: The application can be easily deployed and managed using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

To get started with the rate limit application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Build the Docker image:

4. Start the application:

5. The application will be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Configuration

The rate limit configuration can be customized to suit your needs. The configuration file is located at `app/config.py`. Modify the values according to your desired rate limits:

```python
# app/config.py

# Rate limit values
REQUEST_LIMIT = 5  # Maximum number of requests allowed
TIME_FRAME = 180  # Time frame (in seconds) within which the requests limit applies





Feel free to adjust the REQUEST_LIMIT and TIME_FRAME values to meet your requirements.

Usage
To use the rate limit application, simply make requests to the desired API endpoints. The application will automatically enforce the rate limits and return appropriate responses when the limits are exceeded.

The response headers will include information about the rate limits, such as the number of requests remaining and the reset time.
